# My story (so far)

Growing up in Portland, Oregon, I developed a deep connection to the Pacific Northwest. The lush forests and rugged coastlines were the backdrop to my childhood, inspiring a lifelong love for the outdoors. I also learned the value of dedication early on through soccer. Playing competitively through high school taught me that talent is nothing without teamwork, and that perseverance is the key to overcoming obstacles. These lessons have remained embedded in my persona to this day.

My passion for science eventually led me to Oregon State University, where I studied molecular biology and genomics. It was there that I was introduced to the fascinating world of academic research and was drawn in by the potential to make a real impact on people's lives through scientific advancement. That drive to contribute to the scientific community brought me to Oregon Health & Science University to work as a research assistant. Shifting my focus more towards clinical microbiology, I now research antimicrobial resistance, specifically investigating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work has challenged me to combine my molecular biological background and computational analysis with the broader clinical cellular biology, while at the same time deepening my technical expertise.

The backdrop to this professional journey has been painted by personal challenges I've faced related to depression, ADHD, and other mental health issues. I have struggled with these difficulties and can sometimes feel overwhelmed by them, but I have learned that these struggles are also how we grow. Overcoming these challenges has made me stronger and deeply passionate about promoting the importance of mental health. I believe that the connections we make and the communities we build are what truly matter, and I strive to use my own experiences to support others on their journeys.

When I’m not in the lab or volunteering, you can usually find me with a book in hand. Reading allows me to escape into different realms, imagine different realities, and gain new perspectives. My love for literature encompasses a range of genres, from the otherworldly adventures of fantasy to the insightful pages of nonfiction. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and staying up-to-date with new ideas. And, true to my roots, when the need for fresh air strikes, I still hit the trails, immersing myself in the breathtaking natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.
