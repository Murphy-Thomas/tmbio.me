As a researcher in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Oregon Health & Science University, my work centers on the **mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in high-risk clinical populations**. We are specifically investigating *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, a group where mortality rates remain dangerously high. My current focus is on **heteroresistance**, a phenomenon where a minority subpopulation of bacteria exhibits reduced susceptibility to antibiotics despite standard laboratory tests classifying the isolate as 'susceptible.' This discrepancy often leads to unexplained treatment failures, particularly with cefepime, a first-line therapy.

Our recent findings suggest that this phenotype is not random but is driven by specific clinical histories. By analyzing bloodstream isolates collected between 2016 and 2025, we have identified a critical link between prior fluoroquinolone exposure and the development of cefepime heteroresistance. Our data indicates a convergent evolutionary path where fluoroquinolone stress selects for mutations in the *mexZ* gene. This results in the upregulation of the MexXY-OprM efflux pump system, which effectively pushes cefepime out of the cell, conferring cross-resistance even in the absence of the original drug pressure.

To characterize these complex mechanisms, we employ a multidisciplinary approach combining classical microbiology with computational analysis. My workflow integrates **Population Analysis Profiling (PAP)** to detect resistant subpopulations and **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)** to identify genomic markers like *mexZ* mutations. We further utilize **multivariate regression models** to disentangle the relationships between genomic, phenotypic, and clinical features. Ultimately, this work aims to identify predictive markers that can alert clinicians to potential heteroresistance before treatment failure occurs.
